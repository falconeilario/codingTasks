# Data Analysis and Data Visualisation with Python
This is one my data projects for HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp.
## data_viz_task.ipynb

### Task description
The objective is to create graphs using a .csv dataset to explore and analyze the performance of various car models, aiming to answer specific questions based on the data:
- Which of the manufacturers has the car with the highest revs per mile?
- Is it generally more fuel efficient to drive in the city or on the highway?
- What happens when the wheelbase gets larger?
- Does a larger car mean more horsepower?

### Benefits of Learning Python's libraries for Data Visualization
Learning and practicing data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn is highly valuable because:
- They help communicate data insights clearly and intuitively through charts, graphs, and plots.
- These tools facilitate thorough exploration of data, revealing patterns, trends, and relationships.
- Visualizations make presentations more engaging and persuasive, improving understanding of data-driven insights.
- They aid decision-making by providing a clearer picture of data implications and trends.

### Installation instructions
To utilize the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries, you must install them.
Additionally, installing pandas is essential for leveraging its dataframe structure.
#### Install pandas
Pandas can be installed from PyPI using the terminal:
```
pip install pandas
```
#### Install Matplotlib
Matplotlib can be installed from PyPI using the terminal:
```
python -m pip install -U matplotlib
```
#### Install Seaborn
Official releases of seaborn can be installed from PyPI using the terminal:

```
pip install seaborn
```
### Usage instructions
In order to use the three libraries in your file, you must first import them at the beginning of the file:
```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
